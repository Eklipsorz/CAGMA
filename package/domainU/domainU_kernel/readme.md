# Usage

Everything <strong>kernel</strong> dir is coincident with directory structure in linux kernel 4.2.2. Therefore,
you need to do the following:

1. replace the corresponding file according to filename in <strong>kernel</strong> dir or use patch. But if there is a new file, then you directly put it into the corresponding position.
2. replace the .config with config file
3. recompile ur kernel and reboot
