<strong> hypervisor_kernel </strong> dir stores the moified code of linux kernel on hypervisor. The main use of this modification is to add some columes in xenstore (It's similiar to a database) such that xenstore can store additional data. e.g., available memory amount for each VM.

<strong> hypervisor_memAlloc </strong> dir stores the implementation of the fist target and the second target.
